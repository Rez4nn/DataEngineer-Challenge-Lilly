Objectives (Time spent in total 50mins):
1. Create a query that calculates the average number of goals per game between 1900 and 2000.
   goalscorers.csv, average goals, 1900-2000
   Structure: date,home_team,away_team,team,scorer,minute,own_goal,penalty
   Read year date (first 4 characters per line)
   Split to get total goals per game, append and average
2. Create a query that counts the number of shootouts wins by country and arrange in alphabetical order.
   shootouts.csv, count shootout wins by country
   Structure: date,team1,team2,winner,team1_score,team2_score
   Count occurrences of each country in winner column, sort alphabetically, fix special characters
3. Create a reliable key that allows the joining together of goal scorers, results, and shootouts.
   goalscorers.csv + results.csv + shootouts.csv, reliable join key
   Structure goalscorers: date,home_team,away_team,team,scorer,minute,own_goal,penalty
   Structure results: date,home_team,away_team,home_score,away_score
   Structure shootouts: date,team1,team2,winner,team1_score,team2_score
   Create key using date + home_team + away_team for goalscorers and results
   Create key using date + team1 + team2 for shootouts
   - Searches in all 3 using the same key format, combines all 3
4. Create a query that identifies which teams have won a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw.
   Finds all 1-1 draws from results.csv if home_score/away_score = 1
   Stores reliable keys (from Objective 3) of those games, uses key to search in shootouts.csv
   Joins data and which team won shootout
5. Create a query that identifies the top goal scorer by tournament, and what percentage that equates to for all goals scored in the tournament.
    goalscorers.csv + results.csv, top goal scorer by tournament and percentage of total goals
    Structure goalscorers: date,home_team,away_team,team,scorer,minute,own_goal,penalty
    Structure results: date,home_team,away_team,home_score,away_score
    Create reliable key (from Objective 3) to join both files
    Count total goals per tournament (date range or specific tournaments if available)
    Count goals per player per tournament
    Calculate percentage of total goals for top scorer in each tournament

Additional (How I would go about doing it)
1. Create an additional column that flags records with data quality issues
  - Ran out of the hour, but I would check each file for:
    - Missing values in critical fields (e.g., date, team names, scores)
    - Inconsistent formatting (e.g., date formats, team name spellings)
    - Out-of-range values (e.g., negative scores, impossible dates)
    - Add column saying "data_quality_issue" with True/False
2. Resolve the identified quality issues
    - After flagging the data, clean and standardise the csvs, risky unless confident
    - Would take trial and error


Issues/thoughts:
- Not OOP as too simple and is only using 1 file
- Objective 1: No experience with csv files, did look up
- Objective 2: Å characters were perceived different to A (and appeared at the end), changed so Å is treated as A
- Objective 3: Not much experience with CSV joins, did look up how to
- Objective 4: A lot easier after understanding Objective 3
- Objective 5: player NA, Oceana Nations Cup did not have data in goalscorers.csv, data quality issue, probably scorer field is missing or contains (NA)
